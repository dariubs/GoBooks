Then, you'll get hands-on experience writing real-world applications including web sites and network servers, as well as techniques to manipulate and convert data at speeds that will make your friends jealous. In the final chapters, you'll go in-depth with the language and see the tricks and secrets that the Go masters are using to make their applications perform. For example, you'll learn to use Go's powerful reflection libraries and work with real-world examples of integration with C code.

 Programming in Go brings together all the knowledge you need to evaluate Go, think in Go, and write high-performance software with Go. Summerfield presents multiple idiom comparisons showing exactly how Go improves upon older languages, calling special attention to Go’s key innovations. Along the way, he explains everything from the absolute basics through Go’s lock-free channel-based concurrency and its flexible and unusual duck-typing type-safe approach to object-orientation.

any specific language, so you'll find it accessible whether you're
most comfortable with JavaScript, Ruby, Python, Java, or C++.

The book features hundreds of interesting and practical examples of
idiomatic Go code that cover the whole language, its most important libraries,
and a wide range of applications.
Source code is freely available for download from the book's companion web site
[gopl.io](http://gopl.io/),
and may be conveniently fetched, built, and installed using the `go get` command.
