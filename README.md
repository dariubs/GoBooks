<img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/cover/9781492077206/250w/" width="120px"/>

Go is rapidly becoming the preferred language for building web services. While there are plenty of tutorials available that teach Go's syntax to developers with experience in other programming languages, tutorials aren't enough. They don't teach Go's idioms, so developers end up recreating patterns that don't make sense in a Go context. This practical guide provides the essential background you need to write clear and idiomatic Go.

No matter your level of experience, you'll learn how to think like a Go developer. Author Jon Bodner introduces the design patterns experienced Go developers have adopted and explores the rationale for using them. You'll also get a preview of Go's upcoming generics support and how it fits into the language.

- Learn how to write idiomatic code in Go and design a Go project
- Understand the reasons for the design decisions in Go
- Set up a Go development environment for a solo developer or team
- Learn how and when to use reflection, unsafe, and cgo
- Discover how Go's features allow the language to run efficiently
- Know which Go features you should use sparingly or not at all

For the last decade, we have heard stories about Monolith to Microservice transitions and we might think that this transition solves the majority of the problems in the organizations. However, it might end up with mess if you are not aware about best practices of this transition, since Microservice Architecture comes with its challenges. In this book, we start covering production grade best practices of Microservices Architecture and explain when to use it. Then we talk about microservice communication patterns where gRPC comes to the stage. You will see complete examples written in Go with Hexagonal Architecture applied to project structure. You will not only learn how to implement microservices, you will see how to write tests, maintain quality with proper CI, deploy to Kubernetes environment and finally set up an observable system to have better monitoring for your application.

<img src="https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781804617007/cover/smaller" width="120px"/>

This book covers the key benefits and common issues of microservices, helping you understand the problems microservice architecture helps to solve, the issues it usually introduces, and the ways to tackle them.

You’ll start by learning about the importance of using the right principles and standards in order to achieve the key benefits of microservice architecture. The following chapters will explain why the Go programming language is one of the most popular languages for microservice development and lay down the foundations for the next chapters of the book. You’ll explore the foundational aspects of Go microservice development including service scaffolding, service discovery, data serialization, synchronous and asynchronous communication, deployment, and testing. After covering the development aspects, you’ll progress to maintenance and reliability topics. The last part focuses on more advanced topics of Go microservice development including system reliability, observability, maintainability, and scalability. In this part, you’ll dive into the best practices and examples which illustrate how to apply the key ideas to existing applications, using the services scaffolded in the previous part as examples.

By the end of this book, you’ll have gained hands-on experience with everything you need to develop scalable, reliable and performant microservices using Go.

<img src="https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781803238012/cover/smaller" width="120px"/>

Event-driven architecture in Golang is an approach used to develop applications that shares state changes asynchronously, internally, and externally using messages. EDA applications are better suited at handling situations that need to scale up quickly and the chances of individual component failures are less likely to bring your system crashing down. This is why EDA is a great thing to learn and this book is designed to get you started with the help of step-by-step explanations of essential concepts, practical examples, and more.

You’ll begin building event-driven microservices, including patterns to handle data consistency and resiliency. Not only will you learn the patterns behind event-driven microservices but also how to communicate using asynchronous messaging with event streams. You’ll then build an application made of several microservices that communicates using both choreographed and orchestrated messaging.

By the end of this book, you’ll be able to build and deploy your own event-driven microservices using asynchronous communication.

<img src="https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781801074858/cover/smaller" width="120px"/>

Gin is a high-performance HTTP web framework used to build web applications and microservices in Go. This book is designed to teach you the ins and outs of the Gin framework with the help of practical examples.

You’ll start by exploring the basics of the Gin framework, before progressing to build a real-world RESTful API. Along the way, you’ll learn how to write custom middleware and understand the routing mechanism, as well as how to bind user data and validate incoming HTTP requests. The book also demonstrates how to store and retrieve data at scale with a NoSQL database such as MongoDB, and how to implement a caching layer with Redis. Next, you’ll understand how to secure and test your API endpoints with authentication protocols such as OAuth 2 and JWT. Later chapters will guide you through rendering HTML templates on the server-side and building a frontend application with the React web framework to consume API responses. Finally, you’ll deploy your application on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and learn how to automate the deployment process with a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline.

By the end of this Gin book, you will be able to design, build, and deploy a production-ready distributed application from scratch using the Gin framework.
